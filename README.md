This project tackles the challenge of protest detection from images, identifying whether an image represents a protest or not. Inspired by the paper ["Protest activity detection and perceived violence estimation from social media images"], we extend its ideas by incorporating:

âœ… EfficientNet architecture for enhanced accuracy

ðŸ”„ Data Augmentation to resolve data imbalance issues

ðŸ“Š Comparative Model Analysis for performance benchmarking

ðŸ“‚ Extended Datasets to compensate for limited public data
